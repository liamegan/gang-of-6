<h2 id="road-to-goldenfields">Road to Goldenfields</h2>
<p>Our heroes make grateful landfall - after their very strange journey with Zephyros - just south of the city of Goldenfields (though the name of the city seems somewhat incongruous with the winter blight in which they find themselves) and start on foot toward the city. On the road to Goldenfields, our heroes notice very few people, assuming the cold of the north is keeping people indoors, our somewhat chilled friends hurry toward the city.</p>
<p>Finally our friends top the rise of the last hill before the city and get their first view of the sprawling city of Goldenfields.<br>
<img src="https://liamegan.github.io/gang-of-6/goldenfields.png" alt="enter image description here"><br>
Before them on the road they see the southwest gate to the city and, seeing that it’s late afternoon, they don’t know where to find either their Arcanist contact, Teramin, nor the twin of the nightstone, and the cold of the day is really setting in, our heroes decide to head into the city and find an Inn. As our heroes enter the city they here a cheery voice yelling “Well met, travellers! Keep yer fingers and extremities under wraps, lest Auril bite them off! Mind yer tempers, and you’ll be most welcome here! Brought goods to sell? The market lies straight ahead. Craving a warm drink? May I recommend a drop of Firebeard’s Firebrandy, sold only at Kelvin’s Comfort, located on yer right just before you enter the market square!”.</p>
<p>Goldenfields is a sprawling, chaotically organised city. Ahead of our friends stretches a wide boulevard, up and down which walk people and wagons. From this branch other, smaller streets and alleys, twisting away from sight into shadow and gloom. The buildings stretching away in all directions are a hodge-podge of styles, ages, and affluency. Here and there is disrepair and signs of old fires either successfully extinguished or left to destroy the house touched.</p>
<p>Ending the evening with some mutton stew, a stiff cup of brandy and a sleep in the stable of Kelvin’s Comfort Inn, our heroes sit around and strategise on their next day.</p>
<h2 id="treat-oneself">Treat Oneself!</h2>
<p>The next morning around breakfast, the heroes resolve to do a spot of shopping before finding Teramin. After asking Kelvin where they might find Teramin, the heroes head out to find a store that might stock what they’re looking for. Enna, sick of smelling like a fishwife, heads out to find a bathouse instead.</p>
<p>After asking around, the group heads to the craftsman’s district of town and finds the best looking weaponsmith - Grimptar’s Weapon Emporium.</p>
<p>Knowing how wealthy he is, Brunhilde, 111k, Kovacks, and Maruk ask Jesse to pay for their weapons, to which he agrees. Brunhilde finds an intricately decorated battleaxe and commissions a new Greatsword, 111k gets a vicious looking heavy crossbow, Kovacks a beautifully crafted longsword, Maruk eyes a buckler escribed with the symbol of Helm, and Jesse a beautifully polished mythril dagger.</p>
<p>Rubbing his hands together, Jesse starts to negotiate with Grimtar - he doesn’t have enough gold on him to pay for everything. After spinning a tale to Grimtar about the saving of a fair maiden and the reward of a cherished gem, Brunhilde and Maruk, knowing the tale to be false and correctly ascertaining the reason for the story, point out the untruth and refuse (somewhat sanctimoniously) to be a part of this falsity. In response Jesse simply refuses to pay for their items and hands over gold enough for the dagger.</p>
<p>Begrudgingly, the others’ pay for their items - except for Maruk who instead resolves to make do with his current shield and leave for the Arcanists’ District.</p>
<h2 id="raouls-reagents">Raoul’s Reagents</h2>
<p>So the heroes find themselves in the twisting streets and explosive environment of the Arcanists’ District. Ducking into the nearest, likely looking store, Maruk and Jesse find themselves in the dusty, spooky interior of Raoul’s Reagents.</p>
<p>While Maruk shops for his required reagents and asks for the location of Teramin, Jesse looks at some of the artifacts and, more importantly, scouts out the probable location of Raoul’s cache of cash. While Raoul is distracted measuring out blood and water for Maruk, Jesse conjures a hand using his divinely inspired powers, opens the draw and fetches back a firstful of money.</p>
<p>Raoul sees our friends from his shop with a hastily drawn map, unknowingly poorer for the transaction. Outside, our friends happen across Enna and set out together to find Teramin’s house.</p>
<h2 id="teramins-treasures">Teramin’s Treasures</h2>
<p>Making their way down Teramin’s street, an oppressive quiet falls upon the party. The sounds of the city fade into the distance and even the breeze seems to fall still. Up and down the dead-end street lie row houses, each house unique in its own way, but as alike the others in their dilapidation and decay.</p>
<p>Teramin’s house is dark and uninviting. The 3-story terrace, once bright in colour, is now marcescent and in a considerable state of disrepair. The windows curtained and filthy, allowing no insight into the interior. Kovacks knocks on the front door, the only sound in return being the echo of that entreaty.</p>
<p>Taking the initiative, and despite the feeling of being watched, Enna transforms into a rat and scurries up the building, searching for ingress to the house, finally she decides to climb the chimney and finds herself in a messy, but clearly abandoned bedroom.</p>
<p>While Enna climbs the house, Jesse and 111k walk to the house from which they feel they were being watched. Knocking on the door yields a conversation with a pretty (if skittish) young woman between the door-crack that provides the boys with the impression that Teramin has been gone from the neighbourhood for some time.</p>
<p>The bedroom that Enna finds herself in has a large canopied bed, a wardrobe, and a desk piled high with books and papers, a curtained window allows only a thin sliver of light to pierce the dusty interior. The pages on the desk contain Common characters in a tiny, spidery scrawl, but in a language that Enna cannot comprehend. Leaving the bedroom, she snatches up a fistfull of the papers for the investigation of her more astute friends.</p>
<p>Leaving the bedroom, Enna finds herself in the hallway and stops briefly, listening. The house is as quiet as a crypt. Leading off this hallway are two doors, one leading to a second bedroom, the other to a nursery. After a quick look around, Enna heads downstairs to the second floor.</p>
<p>Off this landing lie 3 doors, the first one leading to a large closet, within which Enna finds shelves containing wooden boxes. The first of these contains cloth-wrapped glass balls, Enna takes one of these and leaves.</p>
<p>Heading downstairs to the ground floor, Enna makes a cursory investigation of the rooms here - finding a living and dining room - and heads outside to her friends.</p>
<p>Walking outside through the unlocked door, Enna describes what she’s found inside and shows the others the papers and glass orb. With this, the party decides to investigate - some to return property stolen by Enna, others to see what other treasures the house will yield. 111k loiters at the front door, guarding against any unwanted intrusion.</p>
<p>A brief investigation of the ground floor yields very little, from here the group makes their way to Teramin’s bedroom in the hope of some information of his wearabouts and of his strange-seeming disappearance. After a more thorough search, Jesse finds a cunningly hidden box under the bed within which are a great number more papers and a series of small black velvet pouches. Emptying these on the bed turns up a great number of cut and polished gems that glitter in Jesse’s eyes like stars. He palms a number of them with great skill and secrets them into his pockets. Turning out the other sacks yield a great number of polished bone tokens inscribed with Giantish runes that Brunhilde reveals describe different metaphysical concepts like “void” “death” “life” etc.</p>
<p>Jesse, Enna, and Kovacks leave the bedroom (Jesse quite a bit richer) and head down to the second floor while Brunhilde and Maruk decide to put Teramin’s papers back where Enna found them and investigate the desk a bit further. Maruk finds a dagger strapped to the underside of the desk, holding it, Maruk finds himself desperately wanting to take the dagger for himself, his longing to always hold and touch the dagger is overwhelming and only his adherence to righteousness allows him to withstand the pull of the dagger. With Brunhilde’s help, they return the dagger to its hiding place.</p>
<p>In the storeroom downstairs, Enna and Jesse search the remaining containers, finding some small desiccated animal bodies, some bricks that look very similar to the material from which the Nightstone was formed (they each take one of these for themselves) and some small crystal daggers (which Jesse takes for himself).</p>
<p>Finished with their thievery, the group heads out into the late afternoon to find a rough looking man patrolling the street outside. Charming him, Jesse asks him some questions. According to this man, something happened on this street some days past and all of the people had to leave. Anybody who stays overnight goes mad and he refuses to believe that there’s anybody remaining on the street. Finally he directs the group to a more affordable Inn - The Geldenstag’s Rest - on the east side of town.</p>
<h2 id="a-second-night-in-goldenfields">A Second Night in Goldenfields</h2>
<p>As our good friends make their way to the Geldenstag’s Rest for their second night in Goldenfields, we can imagine a number of questions on their minds: What happened to Teramin? What might we do without him? Where is the twin of the Nightstone? What will happen to that poor lady in in the Arcanists District? Will Jesse ever stop stealing?</p>
<p>Clouds loom on the horizon, just out of sight.</p>
